/* Iteration 2 | Book Details

Create a function named getBookDetails() that takes one argument - the book object. The function should return a string in the following format:

"TITLE - AUTHOR - PAGES pages"
*/

book =  {
    title: "The Art of Learning",
    pages: 288,

    let {title, author, pages} = book; 

    return `${title} - ${author} - ${pages} pages`;

  }


/* Iteration 3 | Delete Language
  Iterate over the booksArray, and delete the nested object property language from each book object.
  Once done, console.log the booksArray array to confirm that the property has been deleted from all the book objects.

  Note: You shouldn't change the booksArray manually, but instead, you should iterate over the array and delete the property from each book object.

*/

    for (let i = 0; i < booksArray.length; i++){

    }

    console.log(booksArray); 


  

/* Iteration 4 | Estimated Reading Time: 

    Iterate over the booksArray, and add a new property readingTime to each book object.
  The value of the readingTime should be the number of minutes it will take to read the book. The number of minutes should be an integer (i.e., no decimals).

  Assuming a page consists of 500 words and that the average reader reads 90 words per minute, the estimated reading time for a book can be calculated using the following formula:

  reading time in minutes = (number of pages * 500) / 90


  Once done, console.log the booksArray to confirm that the property has been added to each book object.
*/

// Your code here:



/* Con ForEach
booksArray.forEach(book => { 

  const totalWords = book.pages * 500;  
  const time = Math.ceil(totalWords / 90); 
  book.readingTime = time;                                
}); 

*/
  for (let i = 0; i < booksArray.length; i++) {
   
   const readingTime = (booksArray[i].pages * 500) / 90; //Aplico la fÃ³rmula por cada libro del array.
   
   booksArray[i].readingTime = Math.ceil(readingTime); // Con esto eliminamos los decimales.
